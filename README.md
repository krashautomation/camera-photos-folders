# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

Created a comprehensive React Native camera app with project-based photo organization featuring a modern UI, camera integration, and intuitive navigation.

- Built main dashboard with project grid layout and floating camera button
- Implemented camera screen with capture controls and flash/flip functionality

- Created project detail screens with photo galleries and selection features
- Added project creation flow with custom naming, descriptions, and color themes
- Designed gallery screen with search and filtering capabilities
- Generated 10+ custom images for realistic project thumbnails and UI elements
- Set up proper navigation with expo-router and screen transitions
-Added camera permissions and expo-camera plugin configuration
- Created reusable components: ProjectCard, Header, FloatingActionButton, EmptyState
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces and mock data for app structure

The camera organizer app is now fully functional with professional UI design, comprehensive photo management features, and smooth navigation between all screens.


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
